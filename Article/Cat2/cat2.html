Petting your cat can be a tricky business. It's easy to misread a kitty's signals and end up touching her the wrong way or in a spot where she doesn't like to be touched.

Let's say, for example, they roll around on the floor and expose their tummy. This is their way of showing that they trust you. If you try to rub your cat's angelic belly fluff, however, they'll probably respond with a scratch or a bite. You may think (with good reason) that your cat hates you, or that it's their way of telling you they don't want to be petted at all. In reality, they're telling you that they just don't want you to pet them right there, right now. Some cats do love a good belly rub, explains Petful, but you have to approach it with finesse, and only when they're calm and relaxed.</p>

In 2013, a study from the journal Physiology & Behavior was widely misrepresented as proof that petting cats stresses them out. John Bradshaw, director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol, England reassures National Geographic that it was something in the cats' lives and not the act of petting that contributed to the animals' anxiety. (The experiment actually looked at how cats that live alone experience stress differently from those in multi-cat households.) Petting can comfort your kitty, so go ahead and snuggle up.</p>
